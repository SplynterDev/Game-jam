Game Design Document

Basic concept:

The game wil be a panoramic scrolling platformer with roguelike mechanics, heavily inspired by "Dead Cells",
"Hotline Miami" and "Katana Zero".
The game will use ambients similar to those in Dead Cells and have the gameplay 
mechanics of it fused with Katana Zero, for a more "proggressive fast paced" experience
that rewards the player for being quick to attack and move.

The use of a "rage" or "raging" mechanic that triggers once the player kills or attacks several times
in a row, will therefore be a key feature of this game.
